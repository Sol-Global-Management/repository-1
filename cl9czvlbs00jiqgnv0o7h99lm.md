I'm glad that I've discovered you.

I find your services recommendable irrespective of how we're going to interact.

I'd discuss with you what benefits you want from a provider like Airbnb. I and my team can work with you so that you continue to enjoy good relationships with the guests. This would mean that the trust is placed correctly in you and the service seller. What would you say that the role of a provider like Airbnb is? What should we do for you and the guests so that the experience is complete and both parties have good reasons to recreate it?

I'm aware that people need to build rapport first, so I welcome you to [this conversation](https://medium.com/julian-dumitrascu/building-a-relationship-6d7bf1e3c502).
