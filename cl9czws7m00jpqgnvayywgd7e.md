# Let’s plan housing!

People move more than ever. Instead of trading houses, you can rely on us to help you use a house wherever you choose to live.

Whether a house is built by my team or by another team, we can get you better terms than other realtors do.

**1\. Money**

1.1 You can pay an amount towards owning a house, in one or more installments.

You can pay unequal installments.

You can ask Sol Financial Services for a flexible loan with a lower interest.

You can ask Sol Financial Services to insure your house.

1.2 You can pay rent monthly.

You can pay a monthly premium to Sol Financial Services so that they pay your rent when you default.

**2\. Building**

2.1 We recommend natural materials, e.g. stone, earth, clay, lime, straw, hemp, and [wood](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/40na1_en.pdf).

Sand is [not recommended](https://medium.com/sol-resource-management/land-management-28effc65cdd1).

Cement causes damages. It seems that between 1928 and 2013 we put more than 38 Gt of CO2 into the air by using cement.

2.2 Wooden buildings can have up to [6 storeys](http://www.woodworks.org/experttip/what-is-the-tallest-wood-structure-allowed-per-current-building-codes).

2.3 We can narrow buildings towards the main wind.

2.4 We can we adapt a house to summertime and to wintertime.

2.5 We can make the rooms tall, so that there is room for love,

and dancing.

2.6 We position windows depending on how you want to use sunlight.

Shades are easy to install. We recommend using tree shade, too.

2.7 We suggest sliding doors and windows. They save space.

You can let an insect screen roll out when you slide them open.

What benefits do you want from a modern house?

**3\. Subscription**

We can offer higher benefits than one gets when one buys a house (with one’s own money or with borrowed money) or when one rents a house.

In all 4 cases one must pay tax and insurance.

The general cost of living in a house is hardly influenced by these 4 forms of entitlement and money management, but they influence the cost of using a house. Buying a house with borrowed money seems the most costly form and is followed by buying a house with one’s own money.

Example:

a. One borrows USD 50,000 to buy a house.

One pays back USD 90,000.

b. One buys a house with USD 50,000. This transaction costs USD 1,000.

20 years later one sells the house for USD 40,000. This transaction costs USD 4,000. One buys another house for USD 50,000 and incurs additional costs of USD 2,000.

So one pays USD 67,000 to use a house.

c. One rents a house for 40 years at USD 300 per month. The rent costs USD 144,000.

If one rents 5 houses and a transaction costs USD 300 on average, the transactions cost USD 1,500.

d. One uses a house for 40 years.

We charge amounts close to average rents.

***3.1.1 Why would I pay Sol Real Estate instead of a landlord for the same house?***

We make it easier to move into this house and out of it.

We help manage your relationships with the landlord and the neighbors.

We can inform you about the neighborhood, e.g. its grids.

We offer better terms when you place other orders, e.g. for accommodation when you travel.

***3.1.2 Why would I subscribe to housing instead of buying a house with borrowed money?***

Buying a house with borrowed money makes moving improbable. To the extent that you need the freedom to use another house, you’ll be glad that we offer the most freedom to use houses.

We offer better terms when you place other orders, e.g. for home improvement.

***3.2 Benefits for house owners***

Possibly higher occupancy by fewer people, i.e. higher and more stable income.

Our tenants are probably less costly. If a tenant causes some damage, we incur the repair costs.

We and our tenants maintain houses well and are more interested in their improvement, so we keep higher the value of your house.

Sol Financial Services helps you manage your income better.

We offer better terms when you place other orders.

Let me know what benefits you want!

We’ll plan how we get you these benefits.
