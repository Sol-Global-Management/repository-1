# WhatsApp

Why do we want a more helpful service than WhatsApp?

1\. We have enough programs that work on computers of size 4 or size 3 without us needing to use a second computer. We live better with fewer devices.

2\. Unlike in Medium and Facebook, in WhatsApp and Signal I have to add a person’s name in my contact list so that I know with whom I communicate.

3\. Unlike Signal and Facebook Messenger, it doesn’t show when I’ve called somebody and they didn’t take my call.

4\. It forces us to see to its notifications, so we might end up treating others rather poorly. So we could use [Signal](https://signal.org/download) or [Element](https://matrix.to/#/@solgm:matrix.org).
