# LinkedIn

Why do we want a more helpful service than LinkedIn?

1\. Some people create profiles to start conversations resulting in scams.

When you report them, LinkedIn might write back that those people have violated no LinkedIn rule.

To the extent that a software developer charges for their software, there is no spam and no scamming. Example: One can use Google Workspace only after paying for it. (I ignore the initial trial period.)

The financial service provider of the software developer identifies payers. To the extent that people are held responsible, they don’t take irresponsible actions.

2\. When one tries to visit a user profile, LinkedIn might redirect them [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/unavailable). Because it’s difficult to understand why, we can fire such software developers.

I haven’t heard of this happening when one uses Medium.

It’s difficult to recommend more than [one alternative means of communication](https://medium.com/sol-id).

3\. When one presses the button “Load more comments”, the program might execute this command.

We don’t recommend programs that don’t execute commands.

4\. It displays the “most relevant comments” by default.

Some people have told the machines that do such things and the people who manage such machines to fuck off.

The users of Sol software are free to sort data as they please.

5\. One can make an effort: switch to the most recent “comments” every time they see a conversation. As if any human being had demanded that they watch a film or listen to a conversation in reverse!

6\. It limits responses to “articles” (to 1,250 characters).

When you want somebody to serve you better, you can switch to [id](https://medium.com/sol-id).
