# Telecommunication

# 1. On what principles and guidelines are we going to agree?
1.1 It's useful for telecommunication to be as close to the natural communication as possible.
2.1 I and many others like to see in the profile of our conversation partner your full name and a photograph of your face.
People see one another offline and share their name when they begin to communicate.
