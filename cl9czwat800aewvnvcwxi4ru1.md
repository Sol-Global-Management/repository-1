# Interest on money

*We can discuss less risky ways of earning money.*

One can earn interest on their money from Sol Financial Services (SFS) in the following ways.

*Potential investees / borrowers can discuss with us their plans, so that we agree on financial support for them.*

**1\. One deposits money in their account with SFS.**

Depositors can order a benefit-cost analysis that shows which provider offers the deposit that would help them the most.

We try to offer each depositor some of the best interest rates that can be offered to them at the time of our negotiation. If the highest offer is 5% per year, we try to match that. Here are some topics that might matter to you:

We invest in companies and share our gains with the depositors. SFS pays to each depositor 80% of the return on their deposit.

SFS manages the investments. We choose companies and build with them relationships so that we increase the probability of successful investment.

It’s easy to deposit money into one’s SFS account, e.g. with a payment card. Just let me know!

**2\. One invests money in companies through SFS.**

Investors can order a benefit-cost analysis that shows which provider offers the terms that would help them the most.

We try to offer each investor some of the best terms that can be offered to them at the time of our negotiation. What benefits do you want from investments? What kind of investments do you consider?

One can fund each investment alone or together with others, e.g. with SFS.

SFS pays to each investor 80% of the return on their investment. Example:

One invests USD 10k in a company.

The investee pays 1% of their revenue monthly.

The investor receives 0.8% of the investee’s revenue monthly until the investee pays USD 11k.

The investor earns USD 0.8k (8% of their investment).

To the extent that the investee fails, the investor loses up to 100% of their investment and SFS might gain nothing, so we try to choose the most useful teams.

**3\. One lends money through SFS.**

One can lend money to just about anyone.

One can fund each loan alone or together with others, e.g. with SFS.

SFS pays to each lender 80% of the interest we charge on their loan.

SFS manages the loans. We help lenders and borrowers to agree e.g. on how to secure a loan.

We can insure the loan; exemplification:

a. We don’t insure the loan. The lender risks more than SFS.

a.1 The borrower pays the loan back with interest, e.g. USD 10k + 0.8k to the lender.

The lender earns 8% of their loan.

a.2 The borrower pays back only USD 5.5k (50% of their dues).

The lender loses USD 4.6k (46% of their loan).

Such transactions are not profitable for us, so we act so that we prevent defaults.

b. The lender pays USD 1k (10% of the loan) to insure this loan. SFS risks more than the lender.

b.1 The borrower pays the loan back with interest.

We pay to the lender USD 9.9k (99% of the principal amount) + USD 0.8k as interest. This means that the lender earns 7% of their loan.

b.2 The borrower pays back only USD 5.5k (50% of their dues).

We pay to the lender a total of USD 9k (90% of the principal amount). This means that the lender loses 20% of their loan (18% of their investment).

We have to cover 36% of the loan.

Individuals seem more probable to pay their dues. To the extent that it seems possible that a borrower defaults on their debt, a return between 7% and -20% seems more attractive than one between 8% and -46%.
