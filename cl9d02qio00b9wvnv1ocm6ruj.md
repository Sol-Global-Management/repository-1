To increase your BCR, discuss PMM with SGM!

A human enjoys certain benefits during their lifetime and they incur certain costs in order to get these benefits. Because life is made of exchanges among people. (A physicist could say that we spend energy in order to receive energy, a biologist could talk about metabolism, and a Roman could say: *Do ut des.*)

A person’s benefit-cost ratio (BCR) is the average of e.g. the BCR of the services they provide and the BCR of the services provided to them. They exchange services e.g. in order to be safe, comfortable, or satisfied. My business group, Sol Global Management (SGM), can improve e.g. the ratio between your income and your expenses; in other words: your organisations can become more profitable with our help.

In order to get benefits, one resorts to people, methods, and means (PMM). (Who uses what how for what purpose?) To the extent that you discuss PMM with me, you can increase your BCR.

We can create a table in which we list benefits that you want, the degree to which your current providers help you get them, your current BCR, the degree to which you can get these benefits with our help, and the BCR you can enjoy with our help. This helps us agree to which extent and in what areas you’d enlist our help.
