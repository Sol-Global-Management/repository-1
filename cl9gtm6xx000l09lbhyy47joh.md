# We create Internet nations.

Such an idea has been around since it’s been fashionable to create communities.

I start from language communities. Let’s discuss what we, English speakers, want! (We seem to be [1.3 billion](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_languages_by_total_number_of_speakers) people because English seems the best-sold language.)

Up to 100% of us can associate and manage our lives and resources as we please.

One might be able to live without rules, but we might agree on some principles, methods, and plans.

I’d vote for things that minimise the government, and increase our security.

I am building a team meant to offer one better conditions than their current government offers. This nation is supposed to help us live more freely and better.

**What do you want in your life?**

While we can discuss anything, I’ll mention some topics that can matter.

**Communication**

We agree on what software to use to communicate over the Internet.

**Air**

I invite you to [this conversation](https://medium.com/sol-resource-management/air-management-328868100a6b). It’s meant to start a conversation about services provided by the Sol group, but we can also use it to start here a conversation about what air quality we want and what we do as a nation to enjoy it.

**Water**

We can discuss its availability and its quality starting from [this conversation](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/sol-water-management-julian-dumitrascu).

Most [oxygen](https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/plankton/every-breath-you-take-thank-ocean) comes from the ocean. To live, we need to take great care of air and water.

**Land**

We can discuss its quality starting from [this conversation](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/sol-land-management-julian-dumitrascu).

We can agree on how we interact with ecosystems.

We seem to use 51 million km2 of land for agriculture: 40 million km2 for livestock and 11 million km2 for crops. 39 million km2 are covered by forests. 104 million km2 are habitable, while 15 million km2 are covered by ice, and 28 million km2 are barren.

82% of our calories come directly from plants. It seems fairly simple to live better by preferring plants over animals on our plates.

[**Global land use since 10,000 BC**](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-land-use-since-10000bc?tab=table)

We could agree to own anything together, e.g. land or parts of the biosphere. Anyway, we can discuss ownership. It [seems](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Property_rights_%28economics%29) to be the group of the following rights:

**a. the right to use the good**

This seems the most important right.

We can allow every human to use any land. We can create a database that shows the most beneficial uses of every type and lot of land.

In the English-speaking nation, we can manage rights to land as we please. We can manage land in various groups of users.

b. the right to earn income from the good

We pay one another to ship e.g. ore or plants off it. We can agree on schedules according to which to move resources across the Earth, so that we benefit from them over certain periods.

c. the right to transfer the good to others

One might not need to transfer land. Land doesn’t really move.

One can manage the rights to use the land.

d. the right to alter the good

In the case of land, one can discuss this under the rights to use the land. How / for what is it beneficial to use it?

e. the right to abandon the good

We might not need to focus on this right. One can use the land. When we really need to discuss not using some land, we will discuss it.

f. the right to destroy the good

It doesn’t seem useful to destroy goods. Let’s not destroy land!

We can agree on what to do with the components of buildings and machines when we stop using these buildings and machines. People can ask Sol Resource Management to take them off their land. In our nation, where should one take materials that have become more difficult to use? Ultimately, they are always in nature and they go back into the ground to a great extent. It takes them very many years to become natural resources again. We can agree on how and where to act in order to support their natural transformation. This is work done for people whom we won’t know: our descendants. The more people act together, the better they live. The more generations interact, the better they live.

It seems good to focus on the rights to use resources, starting with land.

**Food**

We seem to want mainly food from the land. We can agree on who sows what for whom.

We can agree on how to store food. It’s less costly to store plants than animal products. We can ship grains, vegetables, and fruits from farm stores to kitchens. We can operate a network of kitchens that offer a benefit-cost ratio higher than cooking at home.

**Money**

The members of the English-speaking Internet nation can decide on how they interact as a group and as subgroups. They can decide e.g. on how to manage the infrastructures for energy, transportation, and telecommunication. They decide who does what works on these networks and how they should be repaid for their services. They can use a financial service provider who lets them transfer e.g. money from 10,000+ households during a certain month for services provided by these specialised teams during the previous month(s). They’d use a data management program that lets them negotiate and conclude agreements for such works.

We must make sure that we, the English-speaking Internet nation, have the water, food, energy, data management, financial services, transportation, healthcare, and housing that we want. Which other services are basic, i.e. it were difficult to live without them?

It seems useful for communities to cooperate on how they manage water, e.g. watersheds and wetlands. While everybody needs water and can understand water management, some people will have specialist knowledge of water (management), so few people will earn (some of) their living by helping the others to have the water they need. I think that every citizen should have the right to use some water, so that they stay alive and healthy, even when they have no capital. We should help one another to have a capital. To make sure that everyone has e.g. water, we can have each citizen pay a certain percentage of their current financial capital for water. We can keep calculating how much it costs us as a nation to use the necessary water and see what percentage of our financial capital the money spent on water management represents. If it’s 1%, each of us has to pay 1% to water managers according to rules that adapt this amount e.g. to regions and the timing of certain works.

**Identification**

You can use the identity document issued by a traditional government and ask us, the team that serves this nation today, to create a profile for you. It is the profile of a human who speaks mainly English. (Each person can indicate which languages they speak how well.) This profile is a data set that you can manage and show to others using a computing device. It can include:

a. a photograph of your face

You can include at least one photograph and one video recording. Either type of recording can show more than your face. Your head and your neck should not be covered; the rest of your body should.

You must schedule an Internet call with one of us and show at least your face and your current identity document to your fellow English speaker during the call.

b. the name shown on your current identity document or a name of your choice

c. your identification code

It can be something like EN10: the English-speaking human registered under number 10.

d. up to 10 fingerprints

You register your fingerprints during the call, so that our team member can see your fingers.

e. recordings of you speaking

When you want somebody to identify you, you can use a fingerprint reader to send such data to their computer program. They check for matches in our database.

**National management**

We could call this team the nation management team. We help you to manage communication and data, so that you achieve what you want. We help you to vote on everything that matters to you.

As we agree on how this nation benefits you, we’ll agree on what we, any and all members of this nation, we’ll do to get these benefits and on what costs we accept to get these benefits.

*Belgium, Finland, and Switzerland* [*seem*](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates) *to tax people the most. We can live at least as well as people do in Europe, North America, and China, while collecting taxes lower than 45% of one’s income.*

Some traditional governments have found too many reasons to collect money for public services. When an individual pays for a service, they must give some money to their government, too. At the same time, the service provider must give their government a part of their fee. When they divide their revenue among themselves, each team member must give some money to their government again. I suggest that only individuals should pay a percentage of their financial capital for public services provided by the employees of the English-speaking nations for services that they provide every month. Example: If we pay specialised teams to manage the transportation infrastructure, we can pay monthly, but we pay directly to them, so no taxes are collected. We pay the nation management team for their services. They don’t collect taxes. In the same way, we can pay educators directly, even if we pay them every month e.g. for 4 years; we don’t pay taxes for education all our lives. We can agree on what percentage of all the money that one ever has one would pay to the management team after we agree on what benefits we want by organising ourselves as this language-based nation and by having few of us working continuously to help us get organised.

We can reduce costs related to licenses. We can let people provide any services they like providing. We can see to it that they learn their trade timely. When a service is not in demand, they might change their trade to the one they can actually master and excel at. We can help our fellow English speakers join the right teams and build teams.

You can spend less on accounting services because you pay more simply for fewer public services.

We can insure ourselves and our property. The insurer would pay for emergency services, e.g. fighting a fire, after the service is provided.

How do you want to care for the elderly? [William A. Haseltine](https://medium.com/u/3e3669dfd70c) [wrote](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2020/01/10/top-10-tips-for-caring-for-older-adults/?sh=7c94c8b37a5e) that care should be given at home, which makes it more probable for the elderly to still have a life, because loneliness kills.

These are words from a person in a billion. Let’s read, and listen to, words from more of us!
