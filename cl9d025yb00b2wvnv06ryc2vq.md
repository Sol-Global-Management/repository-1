Screens have a rectangular surface with horizontal length because we try to cover our field of view.

1\. How much are we going to change the shape of this surface?

Could we use oval screens?

2\. Some programmers have us scrolling down, lower, and lower.

We like to sense things, because this helps us to control them. When some images are not displayed anymore, they are more difficult to manage.

We would let you have id split content and display subsequent parts to the side of the previous part, e.g. part 1, part 2, …, part n e.g. from left to right. You could have id hide between 1% and 100% of certain parts, e.g. as if you’d stack sheets of paper. You could change the display scale of any content part. You can have id move any part / series beyond any edge of the computer screen and back into focus.

Such things are related to our attempt to allow brains to handle displayed images as they seem used to: as if they were objects, e.g. books, mugs, or hammers. A main feature is to help people to move data and interface components around so that they can work better.
