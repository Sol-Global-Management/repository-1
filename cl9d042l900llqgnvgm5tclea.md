# How willing were you to discuss with me what you are trying to achieve?

[This conversation](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/building-relationship-julian-dumitrascu) would help us build a dialogue.

I represent goal-fulfilling teams. We are willing to do whatever it takes for someone to achieve their goals.

We are building a global network of communicators in order to provide the most effective communication services. This includes getting through to a certain service provider even if they’re slow or reluctant to communicate publicly, and using the most useful software to manage communication. Before that, we try to understand people’s goals and we agree with them on a plan to achieve their first goal.
