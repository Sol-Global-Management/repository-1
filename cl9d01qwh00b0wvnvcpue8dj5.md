You used Twitter chat to write about this to one of my accounts with them. Because of one of the many faults of Twitter, I am improbable to use that account again. This new Twitter can help us organise conversations more effectively.

In order to agree on how we'd trade with one another, I’d like to build rapport with you. Here’s [my view on this](https://medium.com/julian-dumitrascu/building-a-relationship-6d7bf1e3c502)! I’d gladly have that conversation with you, so that I know your view, too, and adapt, so that we build a fruitful dialogue.
