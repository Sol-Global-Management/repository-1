I'm glad that we can communicate about lists of conversations, i.e. larger topics.

Because you seem to want us to coordinate our resource management better, I've subscribed to you, so that we get more opportunities to communicate.

I welcome any other human to this conversation and to other conversations about how beneficially we can manage natural resources.

I am going to continue to make it easy to communicate with me, so that we can build rapport, which is the first stage of a fruitful dialogue.
