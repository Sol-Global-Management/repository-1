# Ordering food

You can use our [data management program](https://medium.com/sol-id) (called **id** for now) to order e.g. meals.

Let’s say that you choose the dishes, and the time and place of delivery!

You can also choose the kitchen in which the dishes are prepared.

If you don’t choose it and more than one kitchen can make these dishes, id will notify of your request the teams who have subscribed to requests of that particular type.

Each team can choose to notify you that they have just completed a stage of making an offer. You can subscribe to such notifications. If you want to know only whether they make an offer, that’s all id will provide.

You can order dishes over the Internet while being in an eatery and choose that that team serve them or deliver them to a certain address. You can order dishes while being elsewhere and choose that the place of delivery be a certain eatery (which can be part of a chain), i.e. you reserve seats and the meal.

#### **Cooks**

You can subscribe to requests for dishes according to many criteria. We try to cover everything that helps you.

You can focus on any of those of which id notifies you. We can provide a Consider button to tag a request for which you might make an offer.

Then you can press a Start button to start analyzing the request. id will check whether the orders you have taken will have consumed the resources necessary for filling this order. In the best case, you have enough people, stations, ingredients etc.

Whatever ingredients you still need you can order e.g. from our team who delivers food. id lists what you should order. You can edit this form; e.g. you can filter providers. If you want to receive an offer, you press the Request button; if you want to order those ingredients, you press the Order button.

#### **Food providers**

You receive a request for food items, e.g. fish or fruit. id finds them in your storage and helps you plan packing them. When you know what boxes / crates must be picked up when, you can place an order with a carrier. id can help you find carriers, e.g.:

*   pedestrians

Some packages can be carried in one’s hands. Pedestrians can carry them across town if they get e.g. on a bus. They help you reach the same goal, but they can’t invest in more means yet.

*   bicycle riders
*   scooter riders
*   car drivers
*   drivers of trucks of any sizes

#### **Carriers**

*It seems useful for any person to use the Internet over a computer with a screen of at least size 1;* [*this*](http://www.expertreviews.co.uk/vodafone/1405974/vodafone-smart-n8-review-can-it-live-up-to-the-vodafone-smart-prime-7) *is a cheap computer of this size. Telephone communication companies sell such computers in installments. If one buys a used computer, one may need to spend more than* [*USD 50*](https://www.olx.ro/oferta/smartphone-evolio-m5-dual-sim-5-quad-core-android-5-0-3g-radio-IDasvCt.html#4ac687bb53)*. One can buy a size-1 computer in 24 installments and Internet access e.g. for USD 12 per month. If you want better computers or better Internet access, feel free to discuss this with me; my teams can help you.*

When you subscribe for id and we help you configure it, it will notify you of transportation requests. You check whether you and your vehicle(s) can meet the client’s requirements, in this case the requirements of the food provider. id can help you plan maintenance, driving, and fueling. If you are sure you’ll meet the requirements, id helps you make an offer. id will notify you whether the client accepts your offer.

If they don’t, they can change any term of their request and notify whomever of their new request. If id notifies you of this request, you can make a second offer. One scenario is that you make a good offer, but the client thinks they can get a better offer; they can try to negotiate with you e.g. the price or the time of delivery.

If the client accepts your offer, they press the Order button. You decide whether you accept their order. If you don’t, you can make another offer.

You can make any number of offers per request / order. A buyer can post any number of request versions. When a buyer creates a new version, they can choose to deactivate any other versions.

The carrier goes to the food provider’s storage and takes the food pack to the kitchen building. The cooks prepare the dishes and serve or deliver them.

In short, these would be the main stages; the first 2 are optional:

*   A buyer places a request.
*   A seller makes an offer.
*   The buyer accepts the offer, whereby they place an order.
*   The seller takes the order.
*   The buyer [pays](https://medium.com/@JulianDumitrasc/money-management-56955e21a449) by the time agreed by the parties to this transaction.

You can use such features when you trade many other things or carry out other activities.

When you order something, id helps you choose providers and be served better and better.

When you provide something, id helps you organize your operations optimally, increase your revenue, lower your costs, and improve your relationships with your customers.

***id helps people store, discuss, analyze, and process many data, so that it becomes easier to plan things and coordinate e.g. with colleagues and friends.*** You can imagine something better than facebook and odoo combined.

Which of these words do you associate with something that is valuable to you?
