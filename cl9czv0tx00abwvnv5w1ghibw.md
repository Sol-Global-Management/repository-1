# Valuable content for the long term

My teams help e.g. content creators to make and use a resource management plan. Such a plan can cover everything in one’s life, in one’s commercial activities, or in one activity, e.g. creating content. We focus on creators who sell their content. We team up with them to provide content that you value.

We discuss with content users what benefits they want from using content and we serve them in two ways.

**1\. We rent** [**content**](https://www.sol.enterprises/manage/data/content-for-rent)**.**

1.1 We offer at least the main content formats. While we can be seen as another team who combine a *television station* with a *newspaper*, those terms are outdated and not suitable.

We offer content of high quality, content upon request, high technical quality, a reliable service, and good communication.

1.2 Content creators can discuss with us any (payment) terms. We can start with this:

We pay out 83% of the revenue from your content to your account with [Sol Financial Services](https://medium.com/sol-data-management/tagged/solfinancialservices).

We decide whether we feature your content. Users decide whether we continue to feature it; they press a Pay button to task us to pay you.

When we split the money among pieces of content, we take into account how many hours you’ve spent creating the content and what else it has cost you to create it.

**2\. We let content users pay creators directly.**

Our [data management program](https://medium.com/sol-id) is meant to help people buy e.g. content.

Content creators can let content users preview content and ask us to host the content. Everybody has a verified profile and can communicate using more features than those available here. We include things that have been called a *Web site* and a *Web* *shop*. Everybody can manage more data about the traded content than the data available when using other content management services, e.g. YouTube.

We charge every user of our software USD 17 / month.

Our intention is to help content users build good relationships with creators. Let me know what benefits you want to enjoy! You can conclude a detailed agreement with us.
