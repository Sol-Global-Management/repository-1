What's the news about tagging in your X Tiles?

I want to have such a [conversation](https://medium.com/sol-data-management/lets-agree-on-how-to-manage-data-rights-bc2c73e7cfe), too, with software developers. You [wrote](https://xtiles.app/en): "a. Real-time backups and SLA 99.9% b. Information encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (forced SSL) c. Strict policies and controls to prevent staff access"
