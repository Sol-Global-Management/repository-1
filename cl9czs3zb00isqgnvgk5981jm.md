# How do I start using Citrix software for work management?

*You can create an* [*account with Citrix*](https://www.citrix.com/welcome/create-account)*.*

I recommend starting with [Podio](https://podio.com/signup), their program for data management.

1.1 To create a Podio account, one can use:

a. one’s account with Citrix ShareFile or Workspace, Google, or Microsoft.

People with an account with one of these 3 companies probably know how to use it to create a new account or see that it takes a moment to do this. If you don’t, you can ask me to guide you.

b. an e-mail address unrelated with an account with these companies.

Because in this case one also needs a password, this method were less safe. I recommend using a [password manager](https://nordpass.com/) as long as you still use some passwords.

1.2 Somebody on the Citrix team wrote: “Your work email address”

Whether your e-mail address is related to an account with these companies or not, I recommend that:

a. you use your main e-mail address.

The smaller the number of e-mail addresses one uses, the better. One can use only one e-mail address. (To the extent that your use cases are different, we can discuss another configuration.)

b. you use an e-mail address at your [Internet domain](https://domains.google/).

2\. Why use Podio?

When you want to [organise](https://medium.com/sol-data-management/how-is-it-better-for-2-persons-to-manage-data-together-using-podio-bf392a0e1cbb) your information and activities more effectively, you can rely on it as one of the best means.

You can either subscribe for Podio for at least USD 24 per user monthly and pay us thousands to configure Podio, or get all this under this deal:

We create Podio spaces for any individual or group who wants at least one space for their communication and data. (They are similar to the groups designed by Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.)

We configure your space(s) so that you make the most of them.

You can invite anybody and manage your space(s) as you like.

We help you to converse about what matters to you and to achieve your [goals](https://medium.com/julian-dumitrascu/building-a-relationship-6d7bf1e3c502).

When you want to earn money, we can help you to find leads and take orders.

When you want to spend money, we can help you to use the services with the best benefit-cost ratio.

Your remuneration for such help also repays us for hosting these spaces and for paying Citrix for them.
