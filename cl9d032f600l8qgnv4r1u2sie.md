**When should one pay for a product?**

To the possible extent, we should consider that a product is a service provided until the end of the product life cycle, which should be at the latest end of a material cycle.

In many cases we pay after the provider fulfills our order by providing a service or delivering a product. We actually pay after a product is packed and stored. In many cases it’s already closer to us than to the factory. The manufacturer credits us and we credit the last carrier. (I [don’t do miles](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/International_System_of_Units).)

Another consideration is that a service is really wanted when people pay upfront for it. We can help people agree on terms like these: the product user pays on day 1 and they receive the product on day 30. (Well, it can take 60 days.) We make telecommunication easy, so that you can conclude agreements and take orders. We can make it less costly for you to transfer data from received orders to orders to your providers. They could take your order on day 1. Before we discuss in detail what products you want to receive and in how many days you can receive the products you prefer, let’s say that you receive all you need by day 8! While many products can be manufactured faster, let’s say that the product is ready to leave on day 15! Global shipping can take around 45 days. A product for which everything and everybody is ready can be delivered in up to 2 months. (If its design, infrastructure, personnel etc. are not complete, it can take many more months.)

Sometimes people would like to pay for a product a percentage of their income or profit. Because people focus on the value of services, it seems more useful to agree on a percentage of their profit. For this, they would have to agree with you at least on some of their expenses. This can mean that you would pay at least some of your (employees and other) providers gradually, as you receive money from the product users, and that all these people would be more aware of the value of their work. We can help you offer products for monthly subscriptions, which has to do with what [Colette Aubertin](https://medium.com/u/68c15a203195) described [here](https://medium.com/swlh/from-product-to-product-as-a-service-37baed471cd6).

6\. We can [insure](https://medium.com/sol-data-management/insurance-a54ff70b8c8b) your goods and help you provide product warranties.
