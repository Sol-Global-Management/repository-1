# Agreement on travel services

*I am drafting this agreement in public, so that you can discuss it with us and influence it.*

The parties must act with the awareness that the purpose of this agreement is to benefit the livelihoods of all parties through fair planned exchanges.

Guests and hosts may ask the agency for any actions that would help them build their business relationship.

**Guests**

Guests must use the means made available under this agreement according to the applicable provisions.

**Hosts**

**To register a housing unit with Sol Real Estate**

Hosts must make available to the agency over the Internet data about themselves, the properties they want to rent, and the relations between themselves and each property. Examples:

*   a document that identifies the natural person who is or represents the host;
*   if applicable, a document that shows that this natural person may represent the legal person that concludes this agreement;
*   a document that shows that the host may rent the property;
*   a document that identifies the property;
*   an official drawing of the property;
*   a detailed video recording of the property every year and every other time the agency requests it;
*   a video call with their Sol relationship manager.

Hosts may edit, disable, enable, and delete their profiles and their listings at any time.

**Before each stay**

Guests and hosts must agree on how each of them can summon which emergency services during the stay.

Guests must pay the agency at the latest when they check out. The agency charges a guest if their payment is due and the service has been provided.

**During each stay**

Hosts must make sure that each guest can walk into, and out of, the rented unit at any time during their stay.

Guests and hosts must not disturb each other’s legal activities. When a legal activity of one of them disturbs the other:

*   they must agree on actions that allow that activity to continue undisturbed as soon as possible;
*   to the extent that this fails, they must ask the agency to decide on actions to this effect;
*   to the extent that they disobey the agency’s decisions, they must ask the local authorities for legal support.

To claim compensation for costs caused to them by at least one guest, a host must:

a. Record in the presence of one legally responsible guest a video of all the properties and goods which they are about to rent to them.

b. Record in the presence of (if possible) the same legally responsible guest a video of all the properties and goods which they have rented to them, when the guest checks out.

c. To the extent that the host proves e.g. through these 2 recordings that at least one of these guests caused them during that stay costs higher than those they had agreed to incur, a guest must transfer without delay to the host’s account with Sol Financial Services the sum of:

*   the amount in USD that helps the host to repair or replace the damaged goods;
*   the amount in USD corresponding to the value of orders the host refused because these goods were repaired or replaced;
*   the sum of the above to compensate for moral damages.

A guest may record a host and a host may record a guest when they agree on it and when one might take legal action against the other.

**After any stay**

The agency transfers to the host’s account with Sol Financial Services 86% of the amount received from the guest, within 15 days from that payment.

To the extent that a host or the agency causes a guest a cost which the guest hasn’t agreed to incur, they must compensate the guest without delay.

Hosts are allowed to not host guests when an act of God prevents them from it. They must prove the act of God to the Sol agency and to a guest without delay. The agency must help guests promptly to agree with hosts on the alternative accommodation that helps the guests the most.

**The agency**

The agency must store private data securely and grant rights to them only to people who must use them when they must use them.

The agency stores all data securely. They grant guests the right to sense data provided by hosts for them. They grant hosts the right to sense data provided by guests for them.

It includes, and supersedes the conflicting provisions of, the agreement between each guest and their hosts. The parties must also observe the applicable provisions under the laws of Romania, the laws of the European Union, and international laws.
