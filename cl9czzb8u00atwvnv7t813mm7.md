# Twitter

Why do we want a more helpful service than Twitter?

1\. People are free to express themselves, so they are probable to choose a communication program that doesn’t limit the length of their paragraphs.

2\. In order to pay attention to some notifications, one would have to keep a browser tab with their site open.

I’d find it easy to keep open a browser tab with my main communication program or with only one communication program.
