# Services for language service providers

1\. You can ask us to help you manage any data.

1.1 We can adjust your computing environment in order to optimise your benefit-cost ratio of using it.

For instance, we can conduct market research to provide valuable answers to questions like:   
Which computer programs would help us most?  
How best to configure them and make them work together?

1.2 We can help make your business processes as effective and efficient as you’d like them to be.

Work can become easier and more pleasant.

2\. We can help you manage your relationships with some providers.

2.1 You can have us check which providers are best at helping you to achieve your goals.

We include personnel management services, so you can ask us e.g. for account managers or project managers.

When you need new linguists, you can rely on ours. We evaluate them and manage together with them databases with useful information, so we can choose the right people for the right tasks, and the service user will enjoy great results.

2.2 We can deliver to you goods from your providers.

3\. You can ask us to help [manage your money](https://www.sol.enterprises/manage/data/financial-services).

We can help you to choose the most helpful providers of financial services.

If you choose Sol Financial Services, you can ask us for a configuration like the following one. The service buyer presses a button to indicate that you’ve fulfilled their order and thus triggers these actions: we transfer the amount invoiced by you from their account to yours, then we transfer your related dues to your providers. It would help minimise your wait for your revenue. Our 2% fee is the only cost for transferring money between any countries at any time.

***When should one pay for a service?***

*In many cases we pay after the provider fulfils our order by providing a service or, in some cases, by delivering the content processed by linguists.*

*Another consideration is that a service is really wanted when people pay for it upfront. We can help people agree on terms like these: the service user pays on day 1 and they receive the deliverables on day 30. We make telecommunication easy, so that you can conclude agreements and take orders. We can make it less costly for you to transfer data from received orders to orders to your providers.*

*Sometimes people would like to pay a percentage of their income or profit. Because people focus on the value of services, it seems more useful to agree on a percentage of their profit. (For this, they would have to agree with you at least on some of their expenses.) This can mean that your providers would become more aware of the value of their work.*

4\. We can [insure](https://medium.com/sol-data-management/insurance-a54ff70b8c8b) you and help you to provide service warranties.

5\. You can ask us for a more helpful accounting service.

6\. You can ask us for legal services that benefit you more.

For instance, you can place with us orders for notary services.

7\. You can ask us for energy from renewable sources.

Of course we’ll discuss this starting from what benefits you want, so that we agree on how you can enjoy them to the highest degree and at the lowest costs.
