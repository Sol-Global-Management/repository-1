# Let’s agree on the most useful means of communication!

I’ve tried Quora again. I opened my account with them in February 2013.

They seem to have improved this service as slowly as possible.

It seems impossible to use Quora.

I don’t care for questions, so I’ve tried to use their “spaces”. (Software developers use different names for what one can call “groups”. This is one of the many things they have been doing to drive people mad.) I was comparing Quora to Medium, Twitter, Substack, Google Currents, LinkedIn, and Facebook. (reddit is a rather poor service. There are many other programs for public communication; they usually look like more or less lousy toys; it’s difficult to say that they offer a good benefit-cost ratio. The price is no issue; most people can pay monthly the tens of USD that e.g. Google and Microsoft charge for their services mentioned above.) I’ve analysed more than 50 aspects. Medium still looks better than Google Currents. Quora could be a competitor, but I don’t want [this](https://help.quora.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020212652-Quora-Security-Update-FAQ) from any software developer.

I wanted to start such a conversation in this [Quora space](https://www.quora.com/q/sol). It doesn’t seem possible, because I’ve started composing a message in this space. When I press the button “Say something!”, they open my draft. I have 44 drafts on Medium. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/post/edit/drafts) also lets us think about more than one thing.

Quora doesn’t always display post comments. When you don’t display conversations, you don’t enable any.

I’m fed up with spam from Quora, Twitter, and Facebook accounts.
