# Hello!

I'd like to read, or listen to, more words of yours about this.

I think that communication influences a lot the quality of services and the degree to which users benefit from services.

I like using Stripe services. I'd like to see some improvement in how they communicate.

I'd gladly agree with you on when and how we should discuss benefits and costs of business communication.
